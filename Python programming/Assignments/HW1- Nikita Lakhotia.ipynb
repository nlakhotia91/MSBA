Next, create a loop that has the computer's choice be based on the count of the user's choices in the past. For example, if the user's choice count is highest for rock, the computer will select paper. Then, it prompts the user for their choice and prints the outcome of the game. "

We then iterated through all quotes to get a list of all words in quotes and iterated through the tempList to create a list of only unique words. We turned the quote into a list of words and whenever there is a word in the shortList that matches the word we want, we add 1 to the counter. Next, we iterated over every word to be used as keys and iterated over every quote. We only added to dictionary if word appears at least once. In summary, we used the functions listed below to complete the steps a-g.\n",
